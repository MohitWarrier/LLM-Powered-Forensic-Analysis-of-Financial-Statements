      "\n",
      "1. **The company is having trouble turning profits into cash**: The Cash Conversion Ratio is very low, which means the company is not efficiently converting its earnings into cash. This could indicate that the company has high accounts receivable, inventory, or other assets that are not easily convertible to cash.\n",
      "2. **The company's cash is earning very little**: The Yield On Cash is extremely low, which means the company's cash is not being used effectively. This could indicate that the company is not investing its cash wisely or is holding too much cash in low-yielding accounts.\n",
      "3. **The company has a high level of off-balance sheet risk**: The Contingent Liability Ratio is high, which means there is a significant chance that the company will incur liabilities that are not currently reflected on its balance sheet. This could indicate that the company has commitments or agreements that haven't been fully accounted for, or that it has exposure to risks that could negatively impact its financials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these red flags suggest that the company may be facing challenges in managing its financial resources effectively, and that it may have significant potential risks that have not yet been fully disclosed.\n"
